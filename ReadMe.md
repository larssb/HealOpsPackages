# A HealOps package you say?

Exactly right. That is what I'm saying. Specifially a HealOps package acts as a module/snap-in/add-on to the healing and monitoring framework called [HealOps](https://github.com/larssb/HealOps). You put all your *.Tests.ps1, *.Repairs.ps1 and *.Stats.ps1 files in a HealOps package. Where each package acts as a logical container for files (the files just mentioned) acting on a specific IT system and its components.
